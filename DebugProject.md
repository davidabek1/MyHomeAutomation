## Sensor Node
connect Arduino Pro Mini to the computer usb without power line vcc, do connect gnd.  
open serial monitor screen on Arduino tinker.  
check debug messages are printed correctly for each of component work. 
1. found that radio send with retry , without an actual radio card, is taking long and seems like hanging  
but it is not, and after a while it continues the code.
I need to add the radio card, and check how it reacts, and if working properly with serial monitor.
