## use copper as a line
interesting technique to solder copper lines and leave holes for the components that comes last,   
and by the order of heights from shortest to longest.

## use adjacent components and jumper wires
(my style so far)  
better to use jumper wire with non-stranded wires (so they stick and not move)  
and for outside components use stranded wire that will leave longer and not break
